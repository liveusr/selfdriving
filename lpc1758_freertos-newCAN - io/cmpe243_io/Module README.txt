This is the each module source code is separated into a different branch with the prefix "team/<module>"
The source code development of this branch should only occur in user branches with prefix "<module>/user"
The most up-to-date module source code should live in the branch "<team>/<module>"

Any source code or file changes to the branch "<team>/<module>" should be done indirectly through merge requests from user branches on gitlab.

Any development of a new feature or fix for the specific module should have the following format:
"<module>/user/<your name>/<your new module feature or fix>"
